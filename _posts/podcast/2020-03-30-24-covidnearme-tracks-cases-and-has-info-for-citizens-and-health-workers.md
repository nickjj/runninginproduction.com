description:
  Scott Johnson goes over building a Covid-19 case tracking site with Ruby
  on Rails. It's hosted using Hatchbox.io on DigitalOcean.
---

In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} talks about building
a Covid-19 case tracking / anonymous survey / information site using Ruby on
Rails. It's all hosted on DigitalOcean using the Hatchbox.io service (it's
load balanced across 2 servers).

We talked a lot about using Jumpstart Pro, Hatchbox, working with team mates
in the DOD and iterating on a project super quickly. The app's initial release
was created in less than 2 days and it's currently serving 100,000+ visitors a
day.
