In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over building a
project management service using Phoenix and Elixir. It runs on Gigalixir along

Ege talks about using Elixir for the last few years, upgrading to use Phoenix
contexts, building a monolithic app with an API back-end / VueJS front-end,
building his own Stripe billing module, what it's been like using Gigalixir and
more.
