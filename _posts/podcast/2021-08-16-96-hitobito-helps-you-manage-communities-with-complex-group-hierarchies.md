In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over building a
service to help organize groups of people. It's built with Ruby on Rails and is
hosted on OpenShift with Kubernetes. It's been running in production since 2012.

Matthias talks about building a Rails Engine abstraction, creating a multi-repo
monolith, using Sphinx for full text search, making the most of Kubernetes /
OpenShift and lots more.
