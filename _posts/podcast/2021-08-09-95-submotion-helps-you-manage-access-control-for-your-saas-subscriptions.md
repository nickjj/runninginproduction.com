title: "Submotion Helps You Manage Access Control for Your SAAS Subscriptions"
description:
  Kristian Dupont talks about building a SAAS app access control service with
  Koa and Node. It's mostly hosted on Heroku.
---

In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over building a
SAAS app to manage access control to your existing SAAS subscriptions. It's
built with Koa, Node and React and is hosted on Heroku. It's been running in
production since 2018.

Kristian talks about validating his idea before coding it, really leveraging
code linting tools, the challenges of adding a bunch of different SAAS app
integrations, using ElephantSQL to host his PostgreSQL database and more.
