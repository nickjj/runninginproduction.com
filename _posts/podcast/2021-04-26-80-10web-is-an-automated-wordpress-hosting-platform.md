  Tigran Nazaryan goes over building a WordPress hosting platform with Laravel,

---

In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} covers building a
WordPress hosting platform with Laravel, Python and Node. It's hosted on GCP
for their clients' sites and OVH for their core services. It's been up and
running as a hosting platform since late 2020.

Tigran talks about working with a team of 34 engineers, using both MongoDB and
MySQL, creating a bunch of services with a very well thought out architecture
while keeping it simple enough for it to all run on a developer's laptop. He
covered a lot of ground.
