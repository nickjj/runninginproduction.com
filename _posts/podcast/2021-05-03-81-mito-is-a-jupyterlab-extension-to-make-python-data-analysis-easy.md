title: "Mito Is a JupyterLab Extension to Make Python Data Analysis Easy"
description:
  Nate Rush goes over building a JupyterLab extension with Python. The managed
  Jupyter Lab instances run on a Kubernetes cluster on EKS.
---

In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over building a
JupyterLab extension with Python. It runs locally in a Jupyter Notebook but
they also host JupyterHub instances on a Kubernetes cluster running in EKS.
It's been running in production since late 2020.

Nate talks about building a cross platform Python installer, building and
publishing a JupyterLab extension, leveraging Pandas, building the front-end
with React / Typescript, hosting a version of their product on a Kubernetes
cluster, the value in automating the hard stuff and more.
