In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over building a
hardware device that lets you remote control your server without installing
any software. It's been available since mid-2020.

Michael talks about how it works, using Ansible to provision a Raspberry Pi,
Using Flask with SocketIO, rendering 30 frames per second at 1080p with under
200ms latency, using web components, selling his devices on Shopify, hiring
quality freelance developers and more.
