  Cole Simmons goes over building a service for commercial real estate

---

In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over building
an AI driven service for commercial real estate professionals with Flask and
Python. It's hosted on Google Cloud using GKE (Kubernetes) and has been up and
running since 2017.

Cole talks about rewriting the initial prototype, the dangers of not using an
ORM, splitting out the front-end from the back-end, using Google Functions, the
importance in making sure you're building what your users want and so much
more.
