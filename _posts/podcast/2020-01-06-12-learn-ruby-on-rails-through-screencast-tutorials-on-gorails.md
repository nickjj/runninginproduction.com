title: "Learn Ruby on Rails through Screencast Tutorials on GoRails"
description:
  Chris Oliver goes over how he built his video platform using Ruby on Rails.
  It's hosted on a single $20 / month DigitalOcean server.
---

In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over how he
builds and deploys his screencast tutorial platform called [GoRails]({{
page.guest_website }}). The site handles about 2 million page views a year on a
single $20 / month DigitalOcean server. GoRails has been up and running since
2014.

There's a lot of useful nuggets of information in this episode around keeping a
pulse on similar communities that you're in. For example, Chris took a lot of
inspiration from Laravel when it came to implementing the billing code for
GoRails. *Spoiler alert: Rails does scale*.
