In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over building a
video course hosting platform with FastAPI, Strapi and Gatsby. It's hosted on
ECS along with a bunch of AWS resources. It's been running in production since
early 2021.

Chris talks about combining a Gatsby static site with FastAPI, using AWS
Fargate, streaming videos with Cloudflare, supporting both Stripe and Paddle,
using a bit of Serverless Lambdas and tons more.
