title: "TriOptima Is a Service That Banks Use for Portfolio Reconciliation"
description:
  Anders Hovm√∂ller goes over building a reconciliation service with Django.
  It's hosted on bare metal servers in multiple data centers.
---

In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over building a
CME Group owned bank portfolio reconciliation service with Django and Python.
It's hosted on 2 redundant data centers and has been up and running since 2005.

Anders talks about working with 13 other developers to build and maintain this
15+ year old project. It uses a bunch of different databases, handles tons of
batched writes and Anders goes over why the cloud isn't quite the best fit for
this type of app and more.
