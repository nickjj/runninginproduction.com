This episode is no longer available at the moment because it's being reviewed
by 1 or more companies that own this service. **It may or may not come back.
It's up to them.**

If you're wondering if something very secret was accidentally leaked, it
wasn't. We had a conversation similar to every other episode on this site.

However, as a podcast host (this is Nick writing all of this) I very much
respect the decision of a company requesting that their episode gets removed
until they have a chance to review it.
