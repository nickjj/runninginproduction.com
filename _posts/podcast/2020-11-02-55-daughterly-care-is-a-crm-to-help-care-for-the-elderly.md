description:

In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} talks us through
building a custom CRM to help care for the elderly using Django. They are running
on AWS with ECS and the site has been up and running since early 2019.

Barton talks about hiring contractors when needed, splitting logic across 40+
Django apps, heavily using Celery, incrementally improving their infrastructure
over time and more.
