title: "NanoVMs Let You Run Your Apps Faster and Safer with Unikernels"
description:
  Ian Eyberg talks about Unikernels and how he built one with C. Their site is
  built with Golang and hosted on GCP / their own datacenter.
---

In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over creating a
Unikernel with C as well as host a few sites supporting his tool with Go. It's
hosted on Google Cloud and their own data center. Nanos has been available since
2020.

Ian talks about what a Unikernel is, their open source tools and how they
manage their own services. This episode has a healthy mix between background
knowledge on Unikernels and how they (as a company) set up their
infrastructure.

It's worth pointing out you can run your existing applications in a Unikernel
without having to change how it's written and they support running them on most
major hosting providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, your own hardware,
etc.).

## Topics Include

- 12:12 -- Motivation to use Go for building the surrounding sites and services
- 16:51 -- Certain organizations are pushing decent traffic through their Unikernel driven apps
- 19:02 -- How you can run a multi-service app with Nanos (web + worker + db + cache, etc.)
