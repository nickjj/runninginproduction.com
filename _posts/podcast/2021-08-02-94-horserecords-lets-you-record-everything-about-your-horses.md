In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over building a
SAAS app for horses with Django and Python. It's hosted on a single Linode
server and has been running in production since May 2021.

Andy talks about learning Django while building his app, using Django Unicorn,
creating a Django monolith that's broken up with Django apps, outsourcing
setting up a server, the importance of having a good testing team and more.
