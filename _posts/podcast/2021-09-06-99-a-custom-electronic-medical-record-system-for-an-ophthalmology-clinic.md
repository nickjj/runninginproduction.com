In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over building
an internal medical record system with Ruby on Rails. It's hosted on AWS using

using custom generators, embracing PORO, transitioning from Ansible and
individual servers to Kubernetes, making safe decisions while learning as you
deploy new things and much more.
