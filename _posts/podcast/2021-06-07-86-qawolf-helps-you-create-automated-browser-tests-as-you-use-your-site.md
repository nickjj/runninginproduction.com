description:
  Jon Perl goes over building an automated testing service with Node and React.
  It's hosted on Netlify, Vercel, Azure and DigitalOcean.
---

In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over building a
service that automates creating browser tests for your web apps. It's built
with Node and React and is hosted on Netlify, Vercel, Azure Containers and
DigitalOcean.  It's been running in production since 2019.

Jon talks about creating an open source tool and turning it into a SAAS app,
using VNC and websockets to stream test runner data to the browser, keeping
things as a mono repo, moving from Azure Containers to Kubernetes and much
more.
