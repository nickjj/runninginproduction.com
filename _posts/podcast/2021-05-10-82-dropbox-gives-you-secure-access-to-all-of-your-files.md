In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over building
Dropbox with Pylons, Python, Rust and Go. It's mostly hosted on their own
data centers across 1,000+ servers. It's been available since 2008. They have
700+ million users and handle 100k+ requests per second.

Utsav talks about working with hundreds of engineers on a multi-million line
Python based monolithic app, handling payments without Stripe, storing exabytes
of files, using Rust in the desktop client, having remote dev boxes, leveraging
open source tools and tons more.
