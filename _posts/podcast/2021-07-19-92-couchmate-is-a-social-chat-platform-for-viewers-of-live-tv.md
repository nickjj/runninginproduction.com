In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over building
a chat platform with Akka, Scala and React Native. It's hosted on DigitalOcean
with Kubernetes and has been running in production since 2013.

Matt talks about rewriting his app a few times, handling tens of thousands of
nightly TV shows, going all-in with Kubernetes, using Terraform, understanding
it'll take a while to learn things along the way and more.
