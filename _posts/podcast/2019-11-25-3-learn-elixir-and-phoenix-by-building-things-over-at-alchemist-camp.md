title: "Learn Elixir and Phoenix by Building Things Over at Alchemist Camp"
description:
  Mark goes over how he built his platform using Phoenix and Elixir.
  It's all hosted on a $10 a month DigitalOcean server.
---

In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} guides us through
how he builds and deploys his video and article driven learning platform called
[Alchemist Camp]({{ page.guest_website }}). The site gets about 12,000+
visitors a month and it's all hosted on a single $10 / month DigitalOcean
server.

One takeaway is that you can be quite productive as a solo developer but the
bar is constantly being raised for what developers need to learn. For example,
at one point we talked about the new SCA workflows with Stripe since he
collects payments for subscriptions.

## Topics Include
