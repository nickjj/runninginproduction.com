title: "DNSimple Is a Simple and Secure Domain Management Service"
description:
  Anthony Eden talks about building a domain management service with Rails,
  Go and Erlang. It's hosted on bare metal, AWS and Heroku.
---

In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} covers building a
domain management service with Rails, Go and Erlang. It's hosted on a
combination of 70+ bare metal servers, AWS and Heroku. It's been been up and
running since 2010.

Anthony talks about handling millions of API queries per day, ~5 billion
monthly DNS queries, spikes of up to 10,000 requests per second, sticking with
a Rails monolith for the web dashboard, scaling PostgreSQL, building multiple
data centers, feature flags and tons more.
