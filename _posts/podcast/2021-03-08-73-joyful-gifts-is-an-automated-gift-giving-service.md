In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over building a
gift giving service with Django and Python. It's hosted on Heroku's hobby tier
and has been up and running since November 2020.

Jonathan talks about shipping his first app, using Celery for background jobs,
handling non-standard payment patterns with Stripe, not getting caught up with
what everyone is saying to use for tech choices and trying to develop features
based on using the app as a customer.
