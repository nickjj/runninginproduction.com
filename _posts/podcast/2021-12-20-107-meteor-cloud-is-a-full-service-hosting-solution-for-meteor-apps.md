In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over building a
hosting platform for Meteor apps. It's hosted on AWS with ECS and has been
running in production since 2015.

Filipe talks about building critical services with Go, using Meteor to build
front-end web dashboards, the importance of monitoring, using Recurly for
subscription payments, multi-region AWS hosting and overall providing a highly
available platform for thousands of clients.
