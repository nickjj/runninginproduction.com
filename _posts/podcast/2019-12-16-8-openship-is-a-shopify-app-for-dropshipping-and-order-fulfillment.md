---

In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over how he
built and deploys [Openship]({{ page.guest_website }}) which is a Shopify app
that was written in Koa. The front-end uses React.

We covered a lot of ground in this episode, such as how Prisma, Apollo, Next.js
and React all come together to build an app that uses Shopify's API. There's
also quite a lot of details on the value of testing and how CI helps keep open
source projects well tested.
