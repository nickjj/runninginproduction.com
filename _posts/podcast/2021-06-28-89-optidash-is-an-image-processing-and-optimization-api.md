In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} talks about building
an image processing and optimization API with mostly C, Python and Node. It's
hosted on bare metal servers in a data center and has been running in
production since 2019.

Przemek talks about handling 20-50 million+ daily API calls, how they're using
C, image detection techniques, using Lua scripting with nginx, building their
own servers in a data center, using boring technology and much more.
