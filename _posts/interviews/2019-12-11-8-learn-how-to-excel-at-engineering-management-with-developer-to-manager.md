## What's your background and what site are you running in production?

My name is [Siddhant], and I'm a software developer located in Munich, Germany.

I focus mainly on back-end and infrastructure work, and my programming language
of choice is [Python]. I've worked with the language for slightly more than a
decade now and also maintain a few [open-source] modules available on PyPI, so
I consider myself fairly useful with the language.

[Developer to Manager] is a website I launched around October 2018.

%}](https://devtomanager.com)

It's a platform to help software developers who are considering a career in
engineering management. We interview tech leaders at different stages of their
careers, and try to get a sense of what it's like to be in their shoes.

The motivation is to have an open / free set of resources for developers who
are either considering switching to management, or who are new to the job and
could use some advice.

At the moment, the site is mostly a solo project. I'm responsible for software
development and infrastructure (which I'll get into later), online marketing,
curating content, social media, and basically everything else.

The one thing I decided to outsource quite early on is design. [My wife] did
all the design work, and every now and then I bounce design / product questions
off of her. I can't overstate enough how useful it is to have someone in-house
with an eye for product!

A nice side-effect of this manpower restriction is that I try to simplify
things as much as I can. As developers, we often have the tendency to use
technologies just because they are fun.

Having been through the experience now of getting a product off the ground from
scratch, I've realized first hand how important non-programming activities are.
Because of this, I've simplified the software / infrastructure side of things
as much as possible. But more on that later!

In terms of traffic, the site is fairly new and as of November 2019, we're
serving a few tens of thousands of requests per month. But due to how the site
is built and deployed, we've also survived a [Hacker News front page] event
where we received slightly more than 50k requests in a single day.

The site is built using Python / [Flask], and compiled to a set of static files
using [Frozen-Flask] which is then deployed to [Netlify]. We're currently on
Python 3.7.3 and Flask 1.1.1.

## What motivated you to use Flask / Python?

Right from the beginning, I was fairly certain that I wanted Developer to
Manager to be a static site. Just this one decision eliminated so much
infrastructure work that it felt like a good trade-off. Additionally, I wanted
the static site generator to be written in Python, so that in case I run into
any issues or I want to extend something, I can make the changes myself instead
of waiting for someone else.

There are a few really good static site generators (SSGs) in the Python world,
the most popular of them being [Pelican]. What I found though, was that most of
them were tailored around the use case of generating "blogs" instead of
"sites". The data models were restricted to the concept of "posts" and "pages",
which is a fairly tight box to break out of.

Luckily, I found [Statik] which is another SSG written in Python that lets you
define custom data models (not just posts and pages) which makes it super
useful for generating proper sites.

This set up worked well for a few months, until I started running into its
limits. For example, one issue I faced was that I couldn't generate a
`sitemap.xml` file, because the output format was (and [still seems to be])
restricted to `.html`.

At this point, I ran into [Frozen-Flask], which is a Flask extension that takes
a Flask app and compiles it into a set of static HTML files. I had no prior
background with Flask, but all web frameworks tend to support (more or less)
the same set of concepts, so getting used to Flask wasn't too much of an issue.

The only issue I faced was data storage. Flask apps usually store data in a
database like PostgreSQL or SQLite, but this didn't suit my use case that well
because all our site data lives in plain-text files (the interviews we conduct
are all formatted in Markdown).

I knew that Frozen-Flask would give me basically unlimited flexibility since
there's no abstraction layer there. So I spent a weekend writing a simple Flask
extension that enables loading data from YAML-formatted plain-text files into
in-memory database tables constructed on the fly.

This allows humans to write data in Markdown and the Flask app to query that
data using a SQL interface ([Flask-SQLAlchemy], to be more precise).

**The above works extremely well in practice**. I've open-sourced the module
under the name [Flask-FileAlchemy], and it's also available on [PyPI].

If I had to rewrite the app today from scratch, I would most probably still go
for this exact same set up. I like having the comfort of dynamic sites without
compromising on the simplicity of static sites. Python is an amazing language
to get such tasks done, and it's improving day by day.

There's certainly times when I wish for a "normal" dynamic site which would
allow me to implement features like user accounts or the ability to automate
certain sections on the site. But given the fact that the site is a solo
project, this trade-off feels worth it (for now at least).

## Is your site a monolith or broken up into microservices?

It's a monolith. For a repository and application of this scale, microservices
would be completely overkill, so I'm very happy for things to be this way.

I sometimes hesitate calling the site "just a static site", because while it is
a static site in production, it's quite dynamic in development. But it's a
monolith either way.

Currently we only have one `git` repository where the source code and the data
coexist. Since the data is all plain-text Markdown, it's all version controlled
along side the source code.

[Flask-FileAlchemy] (the data storage layer) expects data for every database
table to be in a separate folder. This means that all the site data is very
well organized and I know exactly where everything belongs.

In terms of source code, `sloccount` currently reports about 2,500 lines of
Python + Jinja / HTML code (not counting comments). The site is fairly simple
and I feel this is also reflected in the size of the source code.

## Are you using server rendered templates with sprinkles of JavaScript or is there an API based back-end with a JavaScript heavy front-end?

The primary focus of the site is to display information that is mostly static
and mostly text based.

A bunch of HTML / CSS files being served directly by [nginx] serves that
purpose really well. There are no API endpoints or back-ends to worry about, so
I don't have to muck around with JavaScript heavy front-ends hooked up to JSON
APIs. While these architectures exist for a reason, using them to display
text / static information feels like overkill.

The front-end uses [Bootstrap]. The only JavaScript on the site is the one
shipped with the framework. Similarly, in terms of CSS, I try to stick to the
helper classes that Bootstrap provides, so I don't have to write any extra CSS.
My aim for the site design is that it should be minimal but functional. This
reduces the front-end work even further.

The only CSS / JS modification on top of Bootstrap is the `font-family`
definition. Everything else is basically "factory settings".

So far, I'm happy with this decision. It keeps things rather simple and
minimal, and the amount of software engineering I have to invest stays small.
Like I mentioned before, there are drawbacks of this approach but the
trade-offs so far seem to have been worth it.

## What does the rest of your tech stack look like?

Apart from Flask, I use [Brunch] to concatenate and minimize all the front-end
assets (which is basically just the bootstrap `.css` + `.js` files and
dependencies). I chose Brunch because the configuration is simple and so far it
has "just worked".

Because the site is static, things like databases, Docker, queue back-ends,
etc. aren't there in the stack. This might change in the future in case the
site moves to a more dynamic nature, but at the moment that's not the case.

The domain was originally registered on [Gandi]. I've used them for almost all
the domains I've registered in the past and so far it seems like they deliver
quite well on their "[no BS since 1999]" stance. Although, the DNS
configuration is all in Netlify.

## Which external SAAS tools does your site depend on?

Apart from Netlify that I already talked about, not that many.

For analytics we use [Fathom]. It's a privacy respecting analytics service, so
apart from not tracking / storing any personal user information, it also helps
with the strict data privacy laws in Germany where I'm currently based.

[EmailOctopus] is used for sending out email newsletters. We were using
Mailchimp earlier, but their pricing does not seem to be aimed at smaller
businesses. EmailOctopus is much cheaper, and seems to have a much smaller (and
more thought-out) set of features which makes it quite easy to use.

## Which cloud hosting provider or platform are you using to host everything?

The site is deployed on [Netlify], which is a SaaS platform that lets you host
static sites (among other things).

While they offer an entire suite of products built around the static site
eco-system (including things like user management, forms, lambda functions,
etc.) we're using only the "hosting" bit.

The idea is that you upload a bunch of HTML files to Netlify (or connect a Git
repository if you want continuous delivery), and then they handle the rest
(stuff like nginx, load balancing, caching, SSL certificates, etc.). This
lets me focus on the product and not worry about managing and configuring the
underlying servers and the software installed on them.

Their free offering is very generous, so hosting the site doesn't cost me
anything right now. I have no idea what hardware my site ends up on or what
operating system it's using (and to be honest, I'm not sure if I'm interested
in knowing either), but it's definitely good enough to have survived a Hacker
News spike.

## What does your deployment process look like?

Before deciding whether or not to deploy, I first check that the CI status is
green. We're using [Gitlab] for source code hosting and the in-built [Gitlab
CI] for testing.

{% image interviews/2/gitlab-ci.png %}

At the moment, the CI checks for linting issues in the Python codebase (using
[`black`] and [`flake8`]) and runs a couple of simple tests to make sure that
all the pages on the site can be rendered without any errors and contain what
they're supposed to contain.

The deployment is split into two stages. It starts with generating the site's
content and then uploads it to Netlify.

To generate the site, we first use `brunch` to compile and minimize the
front-end assets. Then Frozen-Flask "freezes" the Flask application into a set
of HTML files. All the resulting files are written into a `build/` folder on
disk.

Once this folder is ready, we use the [`netlify-cli`] tool to upload the
contents of this `build/` folder to Netlify. That's basically it. 

Once `netlify-cli` has done its job, the site is live. I've put these two
steps into a [Makefile] so I don't have to keep them in mind all the time. So
far, I'm happy with how well this process has worked and how simple it is in
practice.

## How have you planned for disasters, unexpected events or malicious users?

One of the advantages of running a static site is that there are not too many
moving parts, so there's not **that** much to plan on this front. Besides,
Netlify provides the option of rolling back to a previous build anytime so
that kind of serves as a "database backup".

In terms of monitors / alarms, there's one monitor set on [Uptime Robot] that
checks the main page every 5 minutes and will send me an email if something is
down, but that's pretty much it.

## What's your advice for others who are running similar stacks in production?

Keep things simple. Pick the simplest tech stack possible that contains the
least number of moving parts. More often than not, this is also going to be the
best way for your product to run in production. Overcomplicating things is
just going to come back at some point and bite you.

Keep things [boring]. The web dev ecosystem is changing constantly, with new
frameworks coming up almost every single week. This is great if you want to
experiment or keep up with trends but when you're putting a product in
production, picking a boring stack is a very good strategy.

Basically, use things that have been proven to work well and you'll almost
never go wrong.

The one resource on this that I highly recommend going through is an article
called [Mental Models I Find Repeatedly Useful], written by the founder of
[DuckDuckGo]. I feel that a lot of these models can be applied to the problem
of selecting a tech stack in production with good results.
